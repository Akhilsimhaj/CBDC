#india economic growth ,financial inclusion and CBDC#

BEFORE WE GO INTO CBDC LETS HAVE A SMALL DEFINITION OF  legal tender money and fiat money

Legal tender means banknotes and coins which are offered in payment of debts and which must be accepted.
Fiat money is not backed by physical commodities, such as gold. Instead, it is government-backed. Most paper currencies today are fiat currencies. Fiat money value is based on the relationship between supply and demand. Fiat holds value because of people’s faith in that nation’s currency.
EXAMPLE ; for easy understanding .when akhil gives a note of 500rupee to Ajay, what akhil giving Ajay is a promise given/made by rbi to pay Ajay who's the bearer of note 500
so the 500 rupee note is legal tender which means it can be used to pay for any transaction in India ..till now everything is fine but CBDC does it in digital format just like the 500rupee note, CBDC is a form of currency note issued by the central bank=insted of physical form its digital formate.

DEFINATION CBDC;"A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is the digital form of a country’s fiat currency that is also a claim on the central bank. Instead of printing money, the central bank issues electronic coins or accounts backed by the full faith and credit of the government." 
YES, NOW IN BACKGROUND OF YOUR MIND SOME concepts running like bitcoin/crypto /digital transfers which may look EVEN similar but they are completely different from CBDC FOR EASY UNDERSTANDING ; There are already thousands of digital currencies, commonly called cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the most well-known fully decentralized cryptocurrency. Another type of cryptocurrency are stablecoins, whose value is pegged to an asset or a fiat currency like the dollar. Cryptocurrencies run on distributed-ledger technology, meaning that multiple devices all over the world, not one central hub, are constantly verifying the accuracy of the transaction. But this is different from a central bank issuing a digital currency.  
 so s of now everything is clear now there are 2type of CBDC
1)wholesale 2)retail

Applications off CBDC 

1)smart contracts;A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. The code controls the execution, and transactions are trackable and irreversible.
LET'S UNDERSTAND IT, BY AN EXAMPLE  USING SUSIDIE MARKET or subsidies provided by the goverment(LIKE Education subsidy, reservation subsidy, agriculture subsidy ..of CBDC can also be fixed and it can be a great way to distribute subsidies.etc) to xyz people like you/me or raju/rani. if at any point in time Raju's income rises to 10lac  for six consecutive months, then automatically the smart contract will revoke the subsidy given by govt to Raju beacuse his income is higher than the threshold line because he no longer needs subsidy .

2) circle of trust; a person like raju  borrows money /sends money /loan from a bank through a loan agreement .all his transitions are well recorded and he will get a credit score based on his behaviour, timely repayment of loan opens diffrent financial services window and higher credit score/line.vice versa 

3)financial inclusion using CBDC; central bank digital currency can increase finical inclusion behind geographical limits or till those millions of unbanked population .in our country there are geographical locations where making physical cash available is a very big challenge. but how it helps, but how? with CBDC an unbanked customer can easily make payments using a smartphone- it can be helpful for an educated person, for those people who come under illiterate /handicapped without education using already Estb e-banking centres / public distribution centres(PDS) TURN THEM  into bank points can help them into  GETTING financial BENFITS Which inturn add them into financial inclusion bracket using Aadhar, biometrics like tump.

4)remittances; When migrants send home part of their earnings in the form of either cash or goods to support their families, these transfers are known as workers' or migrant remittances. They have been growing rapidly in the past few years and now represent the largest source of foreign income for many developing economies.but here come mediators/intermediaries/payment settlement systems like western union/MasterCard/visa . THEY MAKE large sets of payments by  taking/charging 'X %" of the transition amount as fee and in this system a large amount of money is stuck in the banking system and usually take 3-4 working days or even more for payment settlement 

5)can CBDC REPLACE intergovernmental body like the SWIFT SYSTEM; YES, Behind most international money and security transfers is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) system.SWIFT is a vast messaging network banks and other financial institutions use to quickly, accurately, and securely send and receive information, such as money transfer instructions.everything looks good right but here comes problem with swift system.. SWIFT is overseen by the central banks of G-10 countries, as well as the European Central Bank, with the National Bank of Belgium as the lead overseer, majority of control is under the hand of the west,if any unforeseen things happen like war which may or/not be against the interest of the west they will cripple  your economy with a word called "sanctions" like  Russia.so instead of this childish act by a so-called group it is better to have CBDC.But how does CBDC fulfil all international needs? BEFORE THAT JUST GO THROUGH THIS STATEMENT By RBI

(so large amounts of our  gold are kept by different countries (read that red underlined ) now get back to our question. the answer is too simple now CBDC IS NOT BACKED BY ANY PHYSICAL GOOD LIKE GOLD,like CBDC, does not come with any underlying claim to any asset. Its value is based on public perception. The value fluctuates every second which makes it unsuitable as a store of value.,then just by Estb CBDC BANK at country A(like USA,EU ...ETC) and CBDC BANK at country B(INDIA) THEN all the payments made by the domestic player to bank CBDC "B FOR an international player will be settled by bank "A"
